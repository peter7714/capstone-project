1. The tech stack i plan to use is react. i think react is the most fun framework to use and it is the one im most interested in refining my skills in. 

2. The focus will mostly likely be front end because thats where my interest lies. 

3. This will be a website and i think it would be cool to show off to my friends. 

4. my goal is to just create smooth and intuitive youtube clone that way it will be easy for even a laymen to tell it is well made. also to show of my developing chops. 

5. i think mainly my friends, i don't plan to roll out an actual product just something more to show off my skills.

6. i will use 'rapidapi youtube api v3' because its an intuitive youtube api and much easier to work with, its also nice because i don't need a youtube api key just one for rapid api

7. 
    a. won't have a schema, just a frontend app. backend is not my forte unfortunatly. 
    
    b. i have yet to work with an api on my own so a lot be difficult but i have faith in my skills to figure it out. 

    c. no sensitive infomation as this is a front end app. 

    d.  

    e. 
    
    f. honestly a pretty one to one youtube clone. maybe some cool features will be added as i work on it because i'll likely come up with some as i work on the app.
